#scrape-stitchmaps

quick & dirty statistical analysis of stitch frequency of patterns on stitchmaps.com


The upshot is that the most-common 100 stitches cover 99.7% of patterns. Lots of
stitches that are implemented on stitch-maps.com have never been used.

But stitches outside the top 50 occur in 13% of patterns, meaning that there is a
fair proportion of lace patterns that use these slightly unusual variants.
